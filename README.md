# Cloud-Native Campfire 🔥

A community-run series of **Chats**, **Circles**, and **Connects** where we swap stories about all things cloud native. It is a community-driven initiative created by Ryan Etten, CNCF Organizer for Wisconsin, donated for early iteration. **This project has no affiliation with the CNCF and is not endorsed**, though some branding may appear to position it for future growth.

## 🏕️ What Is Campfire Series?

A flexible framework for hosting interactive cloud-native community events:

- **Campfire Chats**: Biweekly Friday open office hours, Q&A style, no agenda.
- **Campfire Circles**: Monthly deep dives into targeted topics, led by rotating experts.
- **Campfire Connect**: Quarterly in-person events (2+ hours) featuring multiple speakers, sponsors, and networking activities.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

1. **Foster Community**: Lower the barrier for participation in cloud-native discussions.
2. **Share Knowledge**: Provide regular touchpoints for Q&A, deep dives, and in-person learning.
3. **Grow Together**: Scale up from local Wisconsin roots to global reach over time.
